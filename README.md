This repository was made to store solutions for some tasks on the well-known resource [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

I will try to save not only the pure code that had AC submission, but also create some approaches for my solutions 
or pick the approach from discussion under the task.

Folder [Templates](https://github.com/H1dd3n0wl/preparation/tree/master/Templates) stands for creating new files for new tasks.   
If you are using CLion, go to File -> Settings -> Editor -> File and Code Templates and 
here you can create your own templates with the help of [Apache Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org/) template engine.

<span style = "color:yellow">_TO-DO_</span>:
* Make automating system for creating directory for the solution.
* Make READMEs for existing tasks
